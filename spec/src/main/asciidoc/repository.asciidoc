== Repository

The repository pattern is a mechanism that allows you to encapsulate storage, retrieval, and search behavior by emulating a collection of objects. In this way, the design further hides the relationship of the persistence mechanism.

This pattern focuses on the closest proximity of entities and hides where the data comes from, making it possible for a Repository to use a DAO pattern.
